All my friends are heathens Take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please dont make any sudden moves
You dont know the half of the abuse

All my friends are heathens Take it slow

Welcome to the room of people
Who have rooms of people that they loved one day
Docked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesnt mean our brains will change from hand grenades

you will never know the psychopath sitting next to you
you will never know the murderer sitting next to you
you will think how did I get here sitting next to you
But after all Ive said
Please dont forget

All my friends are heathens Take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please dont make any sudden moves
You dont know the half of the abuse

We dont deal with outsiders very well
They say newcomers have a certain smell
You have trust issues not to mention
They say they can smell your intentions

you will never know the freakshow sitting next to you
you will have some weird people sitting next to you
you will think how did I get here sitting next to you
But after all Ive said
Please dont forget
Watch it watch it

All my friends are heathens Take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please dont make any sudden moves
You dont know the half of the abuse

All my friends are heathens Take it slow
Watch it
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Watch it
Please all my friends are heathens Take it slow
Watch it
Wait for them to ask you who you know

Whyd you come You knew you should have stayed
Its blasphemy
I tried to warn you just to stay away
Away
And now theyre outside ready to bust
To bust
It looks like you might be one of us

Theres an infestation in my minds imagination
I hope that they choke on smoke cause Im smoking them out the basement
This is not rap this is not hiphop
Just another attempt to make the voices stop
Rapping to prove nothing just writing to say something
Cause I was not the only one who was not rushing to sayin nothing
This doesnt mean I lost my dream
Its just right now I got a really crazy mind to clean

Gangsters dont cry
Therefore therefore Im
Mr Misty eyed therefore Im

Can you save can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul
Can you save can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul
For me for me uh
Can you save my heavydirtysoul
For me for me uh
Can you save my heavydirtysoul

Nah I didnt understand a thing you said
If I didnt know better Id guess youre all already dead
Mindless zombies walking around with a limp and a hunch
Saying stuff like You only live once
Youve got one time to figure it out
One time to twist and one time to shout
One time to think and I say we start now
Sing it with me if you know what Im talking about

Gangsters dont cry
Therefore therefore Im
Mr misty eyed therefore Im

Can you save can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul
Can you save can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul
For me for me uh
Can you save my heavydirtysoul
For me for me uh
Can you save my heavydirtysoul

Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit

Can you save can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul
Can you save can you save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul
For me for me uh
Can you save my heavydirtysoul
For me for me uh
Can you save my heavydirtysoul

Can you save can you save my save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul
Can you save can you save my save my
Can you save my heavydirtysoul
I wish I found some better sounds no ones ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didnt have to rhyme every time I sang

I was toldd when I get oldder all my fears would shrink
But now Im insecure and I care what people think

My names Blurryface and I care what you think
My names Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now were stressed out oh
Wish we could turn back time oh to the good old days oh
When our momma sang us to sleep but now were stressed out

Were stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come Im never able to identify where its coming from
Id make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it never sell out of it Id probably only sell one

Itd be to my brother cause we have the same nose
Same clothes homegrown a stones throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes we all would take the latter

My names Blurryface and I care what you think
My names Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now were stressed out oh
Wish we could turn back time oh to the good old days oh
When our momma sang us to sleep but now were stressed out

We used to play pretend give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then wed fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now theyre laughing at our face
Saying Wake up you need to make money
Yo

We used to play pretend give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then wed fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now theyre laughing at our face
Saying Wake up you need to make money
Yo

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now were stressed out oh
Wish we could turn back time oh to the good old days oh
When our momma sang us to sleep but now were stressed out

Used to play pretend used to play pretend bunny
We used to play pretend wake up you need the money
Used to play pretend used to play pretend bunny
We used to play pretend wake up you need the money
We used to play pretend give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then wed fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now theyre laughing at our face
Saying Wake up you need to make money
Yo
