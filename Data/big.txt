They say your soul mates always nearby.
They say you know hes the one when you feel a little shock in your body, a twinge of electricity.
They say youll feel exhilarated and that your hearts rate speeds up immensely.
They say thats how meeting you soul mates always been like but there have always been rumors floating around that people back then didnt know who their soul mates were and messed around a lot.
If that were true then how did they live like that?
They just went around from one person to another trying to find their soul mate? Did some of them never meet their soul mates?
I could never imagine living like that, besides, relationships between opposite genders before soul mates, unnaturali infirmitate , are frowned upon.
They say its immoral, that its sickening, that things start happening to your brain that make you think irregularly and act irrationally.
As children, theyve told us stories of those that suffered from unnaturali infirmitate , people who become crazy and psychotic have nervous breakdowns.
